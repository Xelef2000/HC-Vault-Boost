Restore a root Token from the recovery keys.
===
Sometimes it is necessary to restore a root token.
A new root token can be generated using the recovery keys or the unseal keys. Since you already setup auto unsealing, we will use the recovery keys.

Read the [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/operations/generate-root) about root tokens.
Then generate a new root token using the recovery keys with the cli.
